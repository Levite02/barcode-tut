### What I learned
I learnt how to add external font-family style to my css and also the different screen resolution for desktop and mobile screen.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

My next area of focus for my web-devlopment plan is to learn more about css media query and javascript. 

### Useful resources
